      <description>Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on lots of teams. Some good, and some not so. But what is it that makes a team successful?
There are the obvious things like the kind of people you have on the team. If the team members just don&amp;rsquo;t get on, if they don&amp;rsquo;t have the skills required to do the job, or they just aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in working hard then it&amp;rsquo;s clear the team will suffer.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Andy, Jon and Gordon are software developers. It&amp;rsquo;s what they do. They enjoy developing good quality software. It makes them happy. They&amp;rsquo;ve been developing software individually for more than twenty years. Fate brought them together when, as individuals, they worked with Just Eat. Andy, Jon and Gordon got on well together. Jon and Gordon worked in the same team. Jon, Gordon and Andy worked in the same office space. They ate lunch together and had many, many conversations about the process of software development and the tools and technolgies that help with that.</description>

      <description>You might recognise our values. When we came together as a partnership one of the first things we did was to list all the things we would always do and all the things we would never do. For example, some of things that appeared in the &amp;lsquo;always do&amp;rsquo; list are be open and transparent about what we do, communicate both good and bad news, work collaboratively and deliver software we are proud of.</description>
