Andy, Jon and Gordon are software developers. It's what they do. They enjoy developing good quality software. It makes them happy.  They've been developing software individually for more than twenty years.  Fate brought them together when, as individuals, they worked with Just Eat. Andy, Jon and Gordon got on well together. Jon and Gordon worked in the same team.  Jon, Gordon and Andy worked in the same office space.  They ate lunch together and had many, many conversations about the process of software development and the tools and technolgies that help with that.  Time moved on. As happens, contracts ended and Andy, Jon and Gordon went on to work with other companies. Andy, Gordon and Jon stayed in touch. Gordon went on to work with ASOS and, whilst there,  recommended Andy to ASOS. Andy started working at ASOS.  Gordon and Andy ate lunch together and had many, many conversations about the process of software development and the tools and technolgies that help with that.  They also had conversations about the challenges of working in new teams. Some of these difficulties arise as part of Tuckman's stages of group development, summarised by the phrase Forming, Storming, Norming and Performing. Other challenges are more technical; the choice of coding styles, tools and the differing levels of ability in a team.

These conversations led to another conversation about how Andy and Gordon would like to work and this conversation led to a conversation about setting up a company to enable working in this way (Andy, Jon and Gordon have a lot of conversations). 


What would be required to set up a company that could work? 

- The people in the company would have to be able to trust and respect each other
- The people in the company would have to have similar views on how software could be developed
- The company would have to provide value to people it worked with in order to remain profitable and stay in business.

Andy, inspired by these conversations, got together a small group of people and invited them to form a partnership.  Of these people, Jon and Gordon shared the vision and accepted the invitation.

Thus Elastic Mint was conceived and born.  A group of individuals who have worked together, who have been through the phases of forming, storming and norming and have now come together as a partnership to provide a pop-up team of software development specialists who can perform.
