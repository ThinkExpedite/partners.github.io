You might recognise our values.  They are the [Extreme Programming values](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html). When we came together as a partnership one of the first things we did was to list all the things we would always do and all the things we would never do. For example, some of things that appeared in the 'always do' list are be open and transparent about what we do, communicate both good and bad news, work collaboratively and deliver software we are proud of.  Some of the things in the 'never do' list included ignoring customer feedback and delivering low quality work. When it comes to it, all of these things that we came up with that shape the way we work are summed up in the Extreme Programming values.

Simplicity is about doing just enough and no more than what is needed. Working in small, simple steps means that we can get feedback sooner.  This, in turn, allows people we work with to make more informed decisions about what to develop next and allows the early mitigation of failures.  Another benefit of simplicty is that it lowers the cost of change, making our software easier to maintain and extend.

Feedback is about delivering working software in each iteration so that we can demonstrate our software early and often. In doing so we are able to gain feedback from the people we are working with and can plan what to do next based on that feedback. We will talk about the project and adapt our process to it, not the other way around.

Respect is about giving and feeling respect as a valued team member. We respect the expertise of the people we work with and we want work with people who respect our expertise. We work with people who respect our right to accept responsibility and receive authority over our own work.

Courage is about doing the right thing regardless of whether we fear doing the right thing or not.  We will tell the truth about progress and estimates. We will adapt to changes when ever they happen.  We don't fear anything because no one ever works alone. 

Communication is a big part of bringing our values to life. Everyone is part of the team and we communicate daily. We will work together on everything from requirements to code. We will create the best solution to our problem that we can together
