You might recognise our values.  They are the [Extreme Programming values](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html). When we came together as a partnership one of the first things we did was to list all the things we would always do and all the things we would never do. For example, some of things that appeared in the 'always do' list are be open and transparent about what we do, communicate both good and bad news, work collaboratively and deliver software we are proud of.
